# Project structure — ISEP Social Network

This document describes the repository layout and a suggested split of responsibilities for group members working on the project.

## Top-level layout

- `socialnetwork/` — main Spring Boot application module
  - `pom.xml` — Maven module descriptor for the application
  - `src/main/java/com/socialnetwork/socialnetwork/` — Java sources
    - `controller/` — Spring MVC controllers (web endpoints)
    - `business/` — business layer
      - `service/` — service implementations
      - `interfaces/` — service & repository interfaces
    - `entity/` — JPA entity classes (`User`, `Profile`, `Post`, `Connection`, etc.)
    - `enums/` — domain enums (e.g. `UserRole`, `IsepSpecialization`)
    - `repository/` — Spring Data repositories (interfaces)
    - `security/` (if present) — security configuration (authentication/authorization)
  - `src/main/resources/` — resources
    - `templates/` — Thymeleaf views (`admin/`, `fragments/`, `userProfile`, etc.)
    - `static/` — static assets (CSS, JS, images)
    - `application*.yml` — configuration profiles
  - `src/test/java/` — unit and integration tests

- `db/` — SQL schema files and database export (use this to create schema in your DB)
- `docs/` — documentation (this file)
- `maven/` — optional local bundled Maven distribution (if included)
- `target/` — build outputs (generated by Maven)

## How the pieces interact

- Controllers expose HTTP endpoints and delegate to services for business logic.
- Services coordinate domain logic and use repositories to persist entities.
- Thymeleaf templates render server-side HTML; Javascript in `static/js` adds interactivity (charts, modals).
- The `admin` pages interact with dedicated endpoints under `/admin/*` and require `ADMIN` role.

## Suggested team responsibility split

If you need to allocate tasks between group members, here is a practical split (adjust to team size):

- Backend Core (1–2 people)
  - Domain model (`entity`), repositories, and core services (user management, posts, messages)
  - Data model and DB migrations (`db/`)

- API & Security (1 person)
  - Controllers, authentication, role checks and session management
  - Admin endpoints and moderation actions

- Frontend & UX (1–2 people)
  - Thymeleaf templates, CSS, and JS (feed, profile, admin dashboard UI)
  - Chart integration and responsive layout

- QA & Testing (1 person)
  - Unit tests, integration tests, test data, and running CI checks

- DevOps / Release (1 person)
  - Packaging, Docker support (if required), deployment instructions, build automation

## Where to add work

- New Java classes → `src/main/java/com/socialnetwork/socialnetwork/...`
- Templates → `src/main/resources/templates/`
- Assets → `src/main/resources/static/`
- Tests → `src/test/java/...`

## Notes

- Use the `db/` SQL scripts as authoritative schema. When developing locally, create a dedicated database to avoid data conflicts.
- Keep `fragments/header.html` and similar fragments consistent — many pages include these fragments for global scripts and styles.

## Production deployment

The application is deployed to a production instance for the ISEP community at:

  https://socialnetworkisep.hangar.garageisep.com/

Coordinate with the project admins before deploying changes that impact the production environment.

If you want, I can produce an example `CONTRIBUTING.md` with conventions for branches, commit messages and PR reviews tailored to your group workflow.
